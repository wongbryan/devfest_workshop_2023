# Quick 3D Banana Demo

This workshop will teach you how to make a galaxy of bananas using Three.js.
Hopefully you'll learn a little about the following:

- Writing shader code (GLSL)
- Working with 3D rendering APIs
- 3D rendering pipeline on the web (buffers, attributes, etc.)
- Having fun while coding
